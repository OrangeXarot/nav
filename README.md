Just a Nav-Bar forcer for my Xiaomi

Usage: `./sups <ip:port>`

Before using it you need to enable adb and wireless adb on your phone
Then pair the phone with the machine you are using (you can use the same phone using [Termux](https://www.f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/)) 

THEY NEED TO BE ON THE SAME WIFI (if you are using Termux you still need to be connected to a WiFi)
